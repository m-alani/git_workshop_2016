# CS Hub Git/GitHub Workshop  
  
  -----
  
  Over here, you will find information and shared resources for the Git/GitHub workshop that CS Hub is hosting @ York University on Fall semester of 2016

  We will be covering the basics of how to use Git (and GitHub) from the command-line. We will firstly talk about Version Control Systems (VCS) and how Git stands out from other options available out there. We will talk about the difference between Git and GitHub. We will give an abstract overview on how Git works as a Distributed VCS. And lastly (and probably most important), we will go through a step by step guide to try the basic commands of Git (Everything you will need to get you started).
  This workshop is by no means trying to make you an expert of Git. It is aimed at getting beginners comfortable enough to use Git/GitHub.
